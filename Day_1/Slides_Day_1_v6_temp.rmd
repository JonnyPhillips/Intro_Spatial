## Geography

- What is your favourite sport?
- Do you speak Spanish?
- Do you know who Fofão is?
- How many kisses on the cheek do you greet someone with?
- If you are on your own in a taxi do you sit in the front or back?
- Do you think government policy should allow free migration?
- Where do you live?

## Geography

- Knowledge and communication depend on where we live

- Social norms and customs depend on where we live

- Political preferences depend on where we live

## Geography

- Tobler's First Law of Geography:

*"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"*

## Geography

- What does 'near' mean?

- Concepts of distance:
    - Euclidean
    - Great Circle
    - Manhattan
    - Levensthtein
    - Mahalanobis
    - Driving
    - Network
    - Minimum-cost
    - Genetics
    
## Geography

- What does 'related' mean?
    - Correlated
    - More similar
    - More different (ex. dialing codes to avoid typing errors)

- 'Related' does not mean one person 'causes' a similar effect on another
    - It may just be a common response to a similar environment
    
## Geography

- [Map of spatial autocorr]
    - points clustered
    - values clustered

## Geography

- But isn't the world getting smaller? 
    - 'The death of distance'
    - Everything is 'near' on the internet
    
- Relevant distances may be changing
    - Cost of flights instead of kilometres or hours
    - Language and social network instead of proximity to radio tower

- Spatial relationships take place at **multiple scales**
    - I am Welsh, British, European etc.
    - The similarities between rural China and rural Russia are greater than the differences

## Geography

- Lots of interesting questions are really non-spatial
    - We can draw maps of them
    - But the conclusion does not depend on the *locations* of the units
    
Non-spatial Question    | Spatial Question
------------------------|---------------------
Which state in Brazil is richest? (DF) | Where in Brazil are states richest? (Southeast)
How many countries have had cases of ebola? (11) | Which part of Africa was affected by ebola (West and Central)?
What is the population of the USA? (~325m) | How many people live West of the Mississippi? (~136m)

## Geography

[****]

- Geography is more than just 'clustering'
    
- A Typology of Spatial Relationships    
    1. Clustering
    2. Natural resources/barriers
    3. Administrative barriers

## Geography

- Physical features also affect social and political processes
    - Attracting economic activity
    - Preventing interactions

## Merits of Spatial Analysis

<div class="column-left">
Opportunities:

- Deeper explanations for common outcomes
- Where helps us understand why
- Avoid confounding relationships
- Enabling new inferential methodologies
</div>

<div class="column-right">
Limitations:

- Data are not 'independent' for statistical analysis
- Data are often aggregated, and the level of aggregation affects our conclusions (Modifiable Areal Unit Problem, Ecological Fallacy)
</div>

## Map Literacy

- Maps are **clear** and **convincing**
    - Patterns may only be visible when arranged spatially
    - If you have *spatial* data, why put it in a table or a chart?

## Map Literacy

```{r, results='asis'}
mun <- readRDS("mun2.rds") %>% st_as_sf()
mun <- mun %>% filter(UF=="AC")

mun %>% dplyr::select(GEOCOD,NOME_AC,POP_2010) %>% st_set_geometry(NULL) %>% arrange(-POP_2010) %>% xtable()
```

## Map Literacy

```{r}
mun %>% st_set_geometry(NULL) %>% ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x=NOME_AC,y=POP_2010)) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90))
```

## Map Literacy

```{r}
mun %>% ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(fill=POP_2010)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  coord_sf(datum=NULL) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low="white",high="red",trans="log")
```

## Map Literacy

- But maps still require careful interpretation

## Map Literacy

- Scale
    - Can I walk from The Art Institute of Chicago to Union Station in 10 minutes?
    
```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Chicago.png")
```

```

## Map Literacy

- Compass
    - What's the best place to view the sunset in the Wirral (UK)?
    
```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Wirral.png")
```

   - Can be manipulated to convey relevant (or misleading!) conclusions
   
```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Legends.png")
```   
   
## Map Literacy

- Choosing the Indicator
    - The most important! What precisley do we want to convey?

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Death_Rates.png")
```

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Color_schemes.png")
```

include_graphics("US_qualitative.png")
```

## Geographic Information Systems

1. Convert the real world into a digital model
    - Necessarily simplified

2. Compare multiple spatial layers

3. Create measures and statistics to describe spatial relationships

## Vector vs. Raster Data

<div class="column-left">
- Vector
    - Start with a blank page
    - Add specific **objects** (points, lines, polygons) defined by coordinates (x,y)
    - The computer stores just the coordinates of the objects
    - Non-spatial 'Attributes' of each object allow complex analyses
</div>

<div class="column-right">
- Raster
    - Start with a grid
    - Each grid square (pixel) has a value
    - The computer stores one value for every grid square (fixed memory size)
    - Mostly for 'continuous' remote sensing (satellite) images
</div>

## Vector vs. Raster Data

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("OS_Map.jpg")
```    

## Types of Vector Data

Type | Dimensions
-----|-----------
Point | 0 | 
Line | 1 | 
Polygon | 2 | 

- An analysis choice, and depends on scale

## Types of Vector Data

- The attributes we assign to vector objects also vary

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Spatial_Data_Types.png")
```

## Locations in Space

- How do we describe the location of an object in space?

- The real world is 3-dimensional
    - Mostly we deal with points on the earth's surface
    - This is not a problem for computers that can create 'virtual earths'

- **Geographic Coordinate Systems**
    - 'Perfect' representations of earth in the computer
    - Longitude and Latitude define any point on earth

## Locations in Space

- Longitude = Angle from equator (N/S)
- Latitude = Angle from Greenwich, London (E/W)

```{r, out.width="700px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Lat_Long.PNG")
```

## Locations in Space

- Longitude & Latitude can be measured in different units
    - DMS: 49°30’00″N, 123°30’00″W
    - DM:  49°30.0′, -123°30.0'
    - Decimal Degrees: 49.5000°,-123.5000°

- But all of these use the same *Geographic Coordinate System*
    - And we 'always' use the same one 
    - **WGS-84**

## Locations in Space
    
- What shape is the earth?
    - An 'oblate spheroid'
 
```{r, out.width="400px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Oblate_Spheroid.PNG")
```   

- This oblate spheroid is estimated by a 'datum' so we get the location correct
    - No need to worry about this, WGS-84 includes its own datum

## Locations in Space

- But we view maps on flat surfaces: paper or screens
    - Try peeling an orange

- To produce flat maps we need a **Projected Coordinate Reference System**
    - Translating 3-D locations to 2-D locations
    - There are many different ways to do this, just as there are many ways to peel an orange

## Locations in Space

- Projections can preserve shape, area or distance, but not all three!

```{r, out.width="400px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Projections.png")
```

## Locations in Space

- Projections are less distorted if they are localized to one part of the earth
    - So we choose a projection based on the extent of our analysis/map

- Ex. UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) Zone

- Use [http://epsg.io/](http://epsg.io/) to find appropriate local projections

## Locations in Space

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Utm-zones.jpg")
```

## Locations in Space

Coordinate Reference Systems have useful shortcut EPSG codes
    - In R, this is all you need

Coordinate Ref. System | Type     | EPSG Code
-----------------------|----------|----------------
WGS-84                 | Geographic | 4326
Corrego Alegre / UTM zone 23S (Coastal Brazil) | Projected | 22523
Chua / UTM zone 23S (Distrito Federal) | Projected | 4071

## Locations in Space

- Which Coordinate Reference System (CRS) should I use? 
    - **Important:** You *don't choose* - your data sources already come with a specific CRS
    - **Important:** ALL data in the analysis must use the same CRS
    - That means sometimes we have to transform from one coordinate system to another
    - For projections, do you want to convey shape, area or distance accurately?
    
## Georeferencing

- With a CRS, computers understand locations such as -23.562778, -46.725261
- But what if we have a street address? 
    - Ex. Av. Paulista, 1578, Sao Paulo 
    - We can use georeferencing databases to return the coordinates
    - Ex. [https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org)
    
## Georeferencing

- We can also take an image and georeference it to a map
```{r, out.width="250px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Captaincies.jpg")
```

- We need to 'pin' the map to at least two points
    - And 'wrap' it around the earth's surface
    - Ex. [https://www.georeferencer.com/](https://www.georeferencer.com/)

## Spatial Datasets

- Non-spatial datasets are just tables

- Spatial datasets just add location data to the table

## Spatial Datasets

```{r, out.width="650px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("map_attributes.png")
```

## Spatial Datasets

- Vector Spatial Datasets
    - Coordinates for every object
    - Multiple coordinates for lines, polygons
    
Code        | Name           | Location
------------|----------------|-----------
001         | Minas Gerais   | -48.77246, -17.773988
002         | Rio de Janeiro | -49.24686, -16.819800

## Spatial Datasets

- Vector Spatial Datasets
    - Coordinates for every object
    - Multiple coordinates for lines, polygons
    
Code        | Name           | Location
------------|----------------|-----------
001         | Minas Gerais   | MULTIPOLYGON ((( -48.77246 -17.773988, -48.77252 -17.773970, -48.77266 -17.773990)))
002         | Rio de Janeiro | MULTIPOLYGON ((( -49.24686 -16.819800, -49.24701 -16.819812, -49.24707 -16.819838)))

## Spatial Datasets

- One single 'Multipolygon' can be complicated
    - Comprised of many distinct polygons
    - Polygons can have 'holes' in them
    
```{r, out.width="250px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Polygon_with_Hole.png")
```

## Spatial Datasets

- Raster Spatial Datasets
    - Coordinates for every data point

x        | y        | value
---------|----------|-----------
-106.05 | 35.96 | 0
-106.06 | 35.96 | 13
-105.07 | 35.96 | 2
-105.08 | 35.96 | 0

## Spatial Datasets

- Historically, vector data has been stored as **shapefiles**
    - Shapefiles separate out the tables, location data, projection into separate files
    
File         | Contains
-------------|----------------
Data.shp     | Geometry details
Data.dbf     | Non-spatial attribute data (a table)
Data.shx     | Indexing of the geometry to match the table
Data.prj     | Details of the projection


## Spatial Datasets

- Raster data is typically stored as .tiff files
    - The same as you get from a camera or scanner
    - But with location and projection data so that we know 'where' the image corresponds to
    
## Non-Spatial Joins

- Most of our data is non-spatial, but *could be* made spatial
    - Election results
    - Death rates
    - Welfare payments
    - Conflict
    
- We can make this data spatial if we link it to existing spatial (location) data 
    - Using common identifiers in both datasets
    - Non-spatial joins

## Non-Spatial Joins

- Governments publish school performance data
    - But what is the *spatial* pattern of school performance? 
    - Better in the city centre or in the suburbs?

- We need a source for the location of the schools
    - Perhaps from a separate geographical survey
    - Or by georeferencing their addresses
    
- How do we combine the school performance and location datasets?
    - By code
    - By name?
