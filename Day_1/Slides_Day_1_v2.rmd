## Geography

- What is your favourite sport?
- Do you speak Spanish?
- Do you know who FofÃ£o is?
- How many kisses on the cheek do you greet someone with?
- If you are on your own in a taxi do you sit in the front or back?
- Do you think government policy should allow free migration?
- Where do you live?

## Geography

- Knowledge and communication depend on where we live

- Social norms and customs depend on where we live

- Political preferences depend on where we live

## Geography

- Tobler's First Law of Geography:

*"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"*

## Geography

- What does 'near' mean?

- Concepts of distance:
    - Euclidean
    - Great Circle
    - Manhattan
    - Levensthtein
    - Mahalanobis
    - Driving
    - Network
    - Minimum-cost
    - Genetics
    
## Geography

- What does 'related' mean?
    - Correlated
    - More similar
    - More different (ex. dialing codes to avoid typing errors)

- 'Related' does not mean one person 'causes' a similar effect on another
    - It may just be a common response to a similar environment

## Geography

- But isn't the world getting smaller? 
    - 'The death of distance'
    - Everything is 'near' on the internet
    
- Relevant distances may be changing
    - Cost of flights instead of kilometres or hours
    - Language and social network instead of proximity to radio tower

- Spatial relationships take place at **multiple scales**
    - I am Welsh, British, European etc.
    - The similarities between rural China and rural Russia are greater than the differences

## Geography

- Geography is more than just 'clustering'
    
- A Typology of Spatial Relationships    
    1. Clustering
    2. Natural resources/barriers
    3. Administrative barriers

## Geography

- Physical features also affect social and political processes
    - Attracting economic activity
    - Preventing interactions

## Merits of Spatial Analysis

## Map Literacy

## Geographic Information Systems

1. Convert the real world into a digital model
    - Necessarily simplified

2. Compare multiple spatial layers

3. Create measures and statistics to describe spatial relationships

## Vector vs. Raster Data

<div class="column-left">
- Vector
    - Start with a blank page
    - Add specific **objects** (points, lines, polygons) defined by coordinates (x,y)
    - The computer stores just the coordinates of the objects
    - Non-spatial 'Attributes' of each object allow complex analyses
</div>

<div class="column-right">
- Raster
    - Start with a grid
    - Each grid square (pixel) has a value
    - The computer stores one value for every grid square (fixed memory size)
    - Mostly for 'continuous' remote sensing (satellite) images
</div>

## Vector vs. Raster Data

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("OS_Map.png")
```    

## Types of Vector Data

Type | Dimensions | 
----------------------------
Point | 0 | 
Line | 1 | 
Polygon | 2 | 

- An analysis choice, and depends on scale

## Types of Vector Data

- The attributes we assign to vector objects also vary

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Spatial_Data_Types.png")
```

## Describing Space

1. Coordinate System
2. Datum
3. Projection
