This course provides a fast introduction to how to conduct spatial analysis for the social sciences. It focuses on the concepts, terminology and tools that students need to be able to analyze spatial data themselves in the course of their research. 

A subsequent course, taught by Laron Williams of the University of Missouri, provides more in-depth training on how to understand and model spatial interdependence.
