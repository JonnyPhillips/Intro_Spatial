**Morning**

1. [Lecture](https://jonnyphillips.github.io/Intro_Spatial/Day_4/Slides_Day_4_v4.html)
3. Demonstration of using Geoda and QGIS for Measurement
4. Demonstration of using R for Measurement

**Afternoon**

Your task in the lab sessions is to produce **TWO** outputs answering the same questions:

a. From your analysis in QGIS, a Word document containing the answers to the questions below, including any maps pasted as images.
b. From your analysis in R, A HTML document produced directly from your analysis.

Lab Question: 

1. [GeoDa+R] Compare one contiguity-based and one distance-based spatial weights matrix for Brazilian municipalities.
2. [GeoDa+R] Calculate the Moran's I measure of spatial autocorrelation for the Theil measure of inequality in Brazilian municipalities. How do you interpret this number?
3. [GeoDa+R] Produce a map of clusters of Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA). Where is inequality clustered in Brazil? Where are the places of surprising low inequality?
4. [QGIS+R] How racially segregated is Ceará state based on the census data?
