## Geography

- What is your favourite sport?
- Do you speak Spanish?
- Who is FofÃ£o?
- How many kisses on the cheek do you greet someone with?
- If you are on your own in a taxi do you sit in the front or back?
- Do you think government policy should allow free migration?
- Where do you live?

## Geography

- Knowledge and communication depend on where we live

- Social norms and customs depend on where we live

- Political preferences depend on where we live

## Geography

- Tobler's First Law of Geography:

*"Everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things"*

## Geography

- What does 'near' mean?

- Concepts of distance:
    - Euclidean
    - Great Circle
    - Manhattan
    - Levensthtein
    - Mahalanobis
    - Driving
    - Network
    - Minimum-cost
    - Genetics
    
## Geography

- What does 'related' mean?
    - Correlated
    - More similar
    - More different (ex. dialing codes to avoid typing errors)

- The relationship does not mean one person 'causes' a similar effect on another
    - It may just be a common response to a similar environment

## Geography

- But isn't the world getting smaller? 
    - 'The death of distance'
    - Everything is 'near' on the internet
    
- Relevant distances may be changing
    - Eg. cost instead of kilometres or hours
    - Language and social network instead of proximity to radio tower
