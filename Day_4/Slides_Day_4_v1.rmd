## Spatial Measurement

What patterns in our data do we want to measure?
    - Where events take place?
    - Whether events are 'clustered' in space
    - Whether attitudes are 'clustered' together (given fixed locations)
    - Whether groups are 'segregated' 

## Measures of Central Tendency

- What is the 'average' place where violence occurs in a city?
- What is the 'average' place where protests happen?

- We use the 'centroid', the average of all points' coordinates
    - Remember, nothing may happen at the average itself

## Measures of Central Tendency

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="Centre of Mass of Brazilian Protests, 2013. Source: Bastos et al 2014", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Centroid_protests.jpg")
```

## Measures of Central Tendency

- We can also measure the 'distribution' of spatial events in two-dimensions
    - A 'spatial ellipse'

## Measures of Central Tendency

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="Population and Mortality in South Asia, Shi et al 2018", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Spatial_ellipse.jpg")
```

## Spatial Point Patterns

- Is the location of protests random? Or do protestors target specific places?
- Is the distribution of hospitals in a city uniform or biased?

- We can calculate the number of 'events' (points) per $km^2$
    - But is the 'expected frequency' of an event constant across space?
    - Often crucial to take into account the background population

## Spatial Point Patterns

- Our null hypothesis is of 'complete spatial randomness'
    - Each location has an equal probability of an event occurring (poisson model)
    - How far away is our distribution of points from this random distribution?

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="Location of Baghdad IEDs. Source: Anselin N.D.", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Point_pattern.png")
```

## Spatial Point Patterns

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="Location of Baghdad IEDs. Source: Anselin N.D.", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Baghdad_IEDs.png")
```

## Clustering vs. Segregation

## Neighbours

- Remember the First Law of Geography?
- Spatial analysis depends on some units being closer to each other than others

- But when am I 'closer' to you?
    - 'Neighbours' are other units that are considered 'closer'
    
## Neighbours

1. Contiguity-based Neighbours

- For polygons, contiguity means 'touching' 

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Contiguity.gif")
```    
    
## Neighbours    

2. Distance-based Neighbours
    - Nearest-neighbour
    - Might not be 'close', but is 'closer'

```{r, out.width="750px", fig.cap="", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("Nearest_neighbour.png")
```
