**Afternoon**

Your task in the lab sessions is to produce **TWO** outputs answering the same questions:

a. From your analysis in QGIS, a Word document containing the answers to the questions below, including any maps pasted as images.
b. From your analysis in R, A HTML document produced directly from your analysis.

Lab Questions: 

1. Produce two new raster files of population density that are limited to only Brazil's territory (one for 1960, one for 2000).   
1. Produce a new map of how the distribution of Brazilâ€™s population has changed over the last 50 years.  
2. Which municipalities have seen the greatest increases in mean population density between 1960 and 2000?
