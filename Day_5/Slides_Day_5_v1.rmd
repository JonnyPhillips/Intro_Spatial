## Political Science and Spatial Analysis

- Combining the methods we have learned helps you measure what it is you are interested in:
    - Average location
    - Clustered events
    - Clustered characteristics
    - Segregation

## Political Science and Spatial Analysis



## Political Science and Spatial Analysis

1. Identifying Clustering
    - Moran's I, LISA
2. Correlating Spatial Relationships
    - Bivariate Moran's I, spatial regression
3. Measuring how one country affects its neighbours
4. How natural geography affects politics
5. How political borders affect modern politics
